  caveats <<~EOS
    SSMV is ad-hoc signed and not Apple notarized. After checksum and bundle
    signature checks, this cask removes quarantine from SSMV.app only so it
    can launch. This bypasses Gatekeeper's first-launch check for this app;
    it does not provide Apple notarization or change global security settings.
